Setting up a new repo for this react-redux demo website

This has been a nice review of my preferences for setting up a brand new nextjs + tailwind + typescript + eslint + scss project

deployed to vercel!  And when I did the few tailwind CSS classes that I'm using so far were not purged on the first deploy

Copying over directories related to the /devblog route, I guess it would be nice if this could be part of a shared npm package so I wouldn't have to copy it into each new project ...
