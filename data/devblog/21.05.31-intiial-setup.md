Setting up a new repo for this react-redux demo website

This has been a nice review of my preferences for setting up a brand new nextjs + tailwind + typescript + eslint + scss project

deployed to vercel!  And when I did the few tailwind CSS classes that I'm using so far were not purged on the first deploy

Copying over directories related to the /devblog route, I guess it would be nice if this could be part of a shared npm package so I wouldn't have to copy it into each new project ...

Playing around with tailwind CSS colors so that the website goes from looking like "I've brought tailwind into the project" to "still not good but the text is readable"

Went to this page [https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/) and got some inspiration for a green color scheme

Found out that if I want 3 different components to all share the same redux store, I can't use `useReducer()`, but instead should use `react-redux`.  This led to me also bringing in the `@reduxjs/toolkit` which has convenience methods for setting up redux

Created a `<Producer />`, `<FoodStand />` and `<Consumer />` components that all connect to that redux store!

Added clip art for "Preston Producer" and "Courtney Consumer"

Added clip art for the food items and showing them in the `<FoodStand />` component!

Experimenting with tailwind responsive CSS classes to adjust the width of the devblog entries

Using React.memo() to prevent the rows of food items from re-rendering unless there's actually a change to the number of items
