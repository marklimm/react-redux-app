Converted my reducer to use `createSlice()` from the reduxjs toolkit.  Doing this means not having to define the redux actions separately, they get defined within the "slice"

Using `react-toastify` to display toasts enforcing when there are too many or too food items to produce/consume (make/sell).  Using redux thunk along with my reduxjs toolkit setup!

Changed "Courtney Consumer" to "Selena Seller" because it fits better with the toast messaging

Added landing page and README.md content

Centering text on the landing page, various styling and layout tweaks
